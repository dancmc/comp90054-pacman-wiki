<h1>Contest submission

The main submitted competition code is extremely messy, but we were reluctant to shift to the updated and neater modular code as there were no more pre-competition days to test with, and we were not sure if the external folder import would work properly. 

Refactored code with the same functionality is located in the branch labeled daniel (links to code in the respective pages, or look in Tags).
